# CodeChronicle

CodeChronicle is an interactive website that showcases the history of programming and computing through a visual timeline, a Hall of Fame of legendary coders, a language genealogy map, and a knowledge quiz, all presented in a futuristic design.

## Features

### Interactive Timeline
- Covers key milestones from 1804 to 2026
- Filter events by category:
  - Programming Languages
  - Pioneers
  - Tools
  - Breakthrough Concepts
- Search events by year, title, or technology
- Click on any event to view detailed information in a modal

### Hall of Fame
- Profiles of influential computer scientists and developers
- Includes roles, notable quotes, and major contributions
- Highlights pioneers such as Ada Lovelace, Alan Turing, Dennis Ritchie, Linus Torvalds, and others

### Language Genealogy Map
- Visual representation of how programming languages evolved
- Interactive nodes showing parent-child relationships
- Click a language to highlight its descendants and connections

### Compare Eras
- Side-by-side comparison of two historical events
- Displays category, year, impact level, and summary

### Knowledge Quiz
- Multiple-choice quiz with 10 questions
- Instant feedback for each answer
- Final score displayed at completion

### Secret Terminal Mode
- Activated using the Konami Code:
  ↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A
  A secret button is also added instead of konami code to unlock the easter egg
- Enables a matrix-style background animation
- Switches the UI to a green terminal-inspired theme

## Design and User Interface
- Futuristic dark theme inspired by developer tools
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile devices
- Hidden easter egg for terminal-style interaction

## Tech Stack
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling, animations, and responsiveness
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity and data rendering
- Canvas API for matrix animation effects

## Project Structure

```

└── README.md
```

## Assets
Coder profile images should be placed in the images folder using the first name of the person as the filename.

Example:
```
images/
├── Ada.jpg
├── Alan.jpg
├── Grace.jpg
├── Dennis.jpg
```

## How to Run
1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open index.html in any modern web browser
3. No additional setup or server is required

## Purpose
This project aims to present the evolution of programming in an engaging and interactive way. It is suitable for educational use, student projects, portfolio demonstrations, and hackathon submissions.

## Future Enhancements
- Theme toggle (light/dark)
- Additional quiz questions
- Timeline zoom or era grouping
- Improved mobile interactions
- Sound effects for terminal mode
